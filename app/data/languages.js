I'm ramping up on Rust right now, and I'm optimistic that it's
a game-changer for system programmers.  The benefits of the
memory-safety mechanisms are huge.  It also has a rich (and growing)
standard library.  "System programmers can have nice things too."

Lua is extremely intuitive, compact, and easy to comprehend.
